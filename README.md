# WINE_QUALITY_PREDICTION

Fixed Acidity: This attribute represents the concentration of non-volatile acids in the wine. It is typically measured in grams of tartaric acid per liter of wine. Acids like tartaric acid contribute to the wine's tartness and overall structure.

Volatile Acidity: This attribute represents the concentration of acetic acid in the wine, which can contribute to a vinegary taste and is usually measured in grams of acetic acid per liter of wine. High levels of volatile acidity can be undesirable.

Citric Acid: This attribute represents the concentration of citric acid in the wine, which can contribute to a fresh and fruity flavor. It is typically measured in grams of citric acid per liter of wine.

Residual Sugar: This attribute indicates the amount of sugar left in the wine after fermentation is complete. It is measured in grams of sugar per liter of wine. Wines with higher residual sugar are sweeter.

Chlorides: This attribute represents the concentration of chloride ions in the wine, typically measured in grams of sodium chloride (table salt) per liter of wine. It can affect the wine's flavor and texture.

Free Sulfur Dioxide: This attribute represents the amount of sulfur dioxide (SO2) that is not bound to other molecules in the wine. Sulfur dioxide is often used as a preservative in winemaking.

Total Sulfur Dioxide: This attribute represents the total amount of sulfur dioxide (free and bound) in the wine. It is also used as a preservative and can affect the wine's stability.

Density: The density of the wine, typically measured in grams per milliliter. It can be used to calculate alcohol content in wine and is a physical property of the liquid.

pH: This attribute measures the acidity or alkalinity of the wine on a scale from 0 to 14, with 7 being neutral. Lower pH values indicate higher acidity, and higher pH values indicate lower acidity.

Sulphates: The concentration of sulfates in the wine, often measured in milligrams of potassium sulfate per liter of wine. Sulfates can contribute to the wine's aroma and stability.

Alcohol: This attribute represents the alcohol content of the wine, typically measured as a percentage of alcohol by volume.

Quality: This is the target variable, representing the quality of the wine sample. It is often a subjective score given by wine experts or tasters, with higher values indicating better quality.
